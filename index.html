        <p>Netflix now allows you to transfer your profile to an existing account, dismissing the need for creating a
            new one. When introduced in October last year, the Profile Transfer feature didn’t have this capability and
            was only applicable to new Netflix accounts.

            This can be a sigh of relief for many as you can get rid of the hassle of creating a new account altogether
            and can easily transfer data between two existing accounts.</p>
        <p>For those who don’t know, the Profile Transfer feature is a way of encouraging people to create new accounts
            and thus, stop using others’ Netflix. Personalized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games,
            and other settings can easily shift to another account and Netflix will continue to provide the same comfort
            you get when you use a shared account.
